Barly – Sow What You Know. Reap What You Learn.
 
Problem Statement
Many learners and enthusiasts struggle to find personalized, real-time guidance when exploring new skills. Existing platforms are either too expensive, lack engagement, or don't foster true peer-to-peer connection. There's a need for an interactive, affordable, and community-driven platform that makes learning and mentorship more human, accessible, and skill-focused.

Revenue Model
Barly operates on a subscription-based model with the following revenue streams:
🔐 Subscription Required: Users need to purchase a plan to unlock the core functionality of the platform — connecting with other users, chatting, and accessing premium features.
📢 In-House Advertisements: Non-subscribed users will see platform-based ads that promote relevant skills, mentors, or community features.
🚫 Ad-Free Option: Subscribers get an ad-free experience as part of their plan.

This model ensures a balance between accessibility and sustainability while enhancing user experience for paid members.
